# BUAA-Computer-Control-Systems
This is the lab projects for the course Computer Control Systems, at Beihang University

## This labwork consists of 4 parts, using an Intel 8051 microcontroller:
1. Keyboard & Display (8 pts)
    * Read input from keyboard by handling interrupts
    * Display numbers on 4 digital tubes (later to display motor RPM)
    * Implement in both C and Assembly

2. Serial Communication (8 pts)
    * Implement serial communication between 8051 microprocessor and PC

3. Motor Drive and RPM Measurement (10 pts)
    * Adjust motor speed with timer-implemented PWM
    * Measure motor speed with a optical tachometer

4. Motor Control with PID (14 pts)
    * Control motor RPM with PID
    * Motor rev was maintained within +/-10 RPM
